# Approaches to Advertising Measurement

---
# Measuring Ad Effectiveness

**Motivation**: Measuring the causal effect of digital advertising

**Specific Questions**:

* What **is** the effect?
* Can we reliably estimate the effect without RCTs?

**How?**: Large scale experiments (15) at Facebook

* Note: This paper is **very** cool
* The authors are *extremely* careful in their explanations

---
# Advertising on Facebook

* Ads appear in the News Feed

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/facebook_ads.png")
```

* Advertiser chooses target demographic(s), users then exposed to treatment / control

---
# Endogeneity Abounds Us (Them)

Concern: Sources of selection bias (Why?)

**User Induced Endogeneity**

* 'Activity bias' - user must be on Facebook during campaign to be exposed

**Targeting Induced Endogeneity**

* Ad delivery system optimizes whom to show ads 

**Competition Induced Endogeneity**

* Displaying ad $\implies$ won an auction  $\implies$ exposed users are highly values (higher expected conversion probability)

$\implies$ estimating causal effects without an RCT will be tough!

---
# What are they Measuring?

**Average Treatment Effect on the Treated**:  effect of the ads on users who are actually exposed to ads

**Lift**


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/facebook_lift.png")
```

---
# Data


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/facebook_data.png")
```

---
# RCT Results 


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/facebook_att.png")
```

---
# Observational Approaches


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/facebook_overest.png")
```

---
# Main Takeaways

* **RCTs are the gold standard for measuring ad effectiveness**
  * Insignificant differences for checkout conversion in 6/15 experiments
  * Significant for registration and page views almost always

* **Observational models generally overestimate lift**
  * Can be wrong by a factor of 3
  * 'Better' for registrations and page views than checkout

# Tweeting as a Marketing Tool

---
# Do Firm Tweets Matter?

**Motivation**: Does tweeting increase demand for their products

**Specific Questions**:

* What is the causal effect of company tweets on demand?
* Do retweets by influential users help?

**How?**: Large scale experiment on Weibo w/ a media company

* Note: (again) This paper is **very** cool

---
# The Experiment

Weibo $\approx$ Chinese Twitter

Industry: documentary TV shows, one show broadcast per day across seven local channels

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/gong_experiment.png")
```

---
# Results

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="63%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/gong_main.png")
```

---
# Results II 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/gong_quant.png")
```

---
# Main Takeaways

* Tweeting: positive & significant effect
* Tweeting + Influential retweet: retweet gives a significant boost

What's the mechanism? (subtle)

* Influential tweets with broadcast time info attract new viewers
  *  Table 8 and 9
* Informative tweets (broadcast time) also attract new followers to company page

# Advertising and Word of Mouth

---
# Can Ads Generate WoM?

**Motivation**: 20% of WoM references TV Ads

**Specific Questions**:

* Does advertising effect WoM (online and offline)?
* What about during large events (Superbowl)?

**How?**: Observational data on WoM and advertising


---
# Data and Model

536 brands, 16 product categories 

**Advertising Data**: monthly ad expenditure from Ad$pender

**Word of Mouth**: 

* TalkTrack from Keller-Fay group ('Engagement Labs' / 'TotalSocial')
* Nielsen's UGC search engine ('Nielsen McKinsey Incite')

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/lovett_eq.png")
```


---
# Results

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/lovett_tab2.png")
```

---
# Category Heterogeneity

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/lovett_hetero.png")
```

---
# Superbowl, Super Effect?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/lovett_tab4.png")
```

---
# Main Takeaways

* **Small**, positive, statistically significant effect of advertising spending on WoM 
  * Question: Is ad spend the *right* variable of interest?
* Heterogeneity across categories
  * Larger for Sports & Hobbies, Media & Entertainment, and Telecom 
* Large events have larger effects that are short-lived

# Recap

---
# Recap

* Measuring (digital) Ad effects is **hard**, endogeneity is everywhere
  * RCTs/experiments are our the best way forward

* Company tweets (these are ads) can generate demand, influential retweets even more
  * mechanism: attracting a new audience 

* Ads can spillover to generate (small) WoM effects
  * Question: can we quantify the effect on demand?
